This app is a search website for photographers and their potential clients to be able to search for local photographers and book a session with them.

The search component uses geocodes to pinpoint someone's location and then will show search results within a 50 mile radius. 

Users will be able to log in with either an email/password combination, or with Google authentication. Users are also able to denote whether or not they are a photographer, and have a profile built in to the marker that shows them on the map.

We used React, Redux, Firebase, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 to build this app, as well as using API's from Google and Firebase.
